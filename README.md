🧾 Work Order Tracker
A real-world inspired production tracking system built to improve operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and enable collaborative multi-user updates in manufacturing environments.

🚀 Project Overview
The Work Order Tracker is a full stack application designed to streamline work order management across production and packing departments. Inspired by real-life workflows in high-speed manufacturing, the app supports:

Multi-user input and collaboration

Automatic status transitions and data persistence

Shift-based performance metrics

Supervisor/admin dashboard for real-time visibility

Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the app demonstrates end-to-end development with a focus on backend logic, UI/UX, and operational impact.

🛠️ Key Features
Live Work Order Dashboard: See all orders in progress, updated in real-time.

Packout Interface: Designed for team-based input; multiple users can contribute to the same order simultaneously.

Status Pipeline: Work orders automatically advance through stages (e.g., Created → Printing → Packout → Complete).

Shift Metrics: Track hourly output, shift totals, monthly progress, and productivity trends.

Admin Panel: Summarized data for management, including individual contributions, quality notes, and logs.

Error Handling UX: Input forms preserve data and auto-redirect after error resolution to prevent user frustration.

🧠 Background
This app was built to solve real pain points observed firsthand on the production floor: fragmented communication, poor data visibility, and downtime caused by manual tracking. With a background in manufacturing and operations, I designed this tool with empathy for the end user and a focus on real business outcomes.
